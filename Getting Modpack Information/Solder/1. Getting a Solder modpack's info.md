# Getting a Solder Modpack's Info

[Solder](http://solder.io) is great for modpack creators however, it makes our job slightly more complicated.

Happily, there is more documentation for Solder, so if you need more help check out [the Solder Docs](http://docs.solder.io/).

## The Request:

Yet another GET request which should look a bit like the following:
```http
{solder-url}/modpack/{modpack-friendly-name}
```

Where:
* Solder URL is the URL we got in 2. Getting a Modpacks Info
* Modpack Friendly Name is the friendly name of the modpack which we found in both 2, and 1.

## The Return

This returns yet more JSON!

It looks a bit like this (for Tekkit Classic):

```json
{
	"name": "tekkit",
	"display_name": "Tekkit Classic",
	"url": "http://www.technicpack.net/tekkit-classic",
	"icon": null,
	"icon_md5": "1db1857730e6e58158ed42dbd5273c0a",
	"logo": null,
	"logo_md5": "45327ab578e28fcddee983922108c268",

```
